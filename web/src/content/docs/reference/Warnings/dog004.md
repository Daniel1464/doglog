title: DOG004 - PowerDistribution initialization error
Description: Description and solution for the DogLog DOG004 warning.
---

## Description

DogLog supports logging data for the PDH/PDP using the `PowerDistribution` class from WPILib.
Only one instance of `PowerDistribution` can be initialized in robot code, so if you're using `PowerDistribution` in your robot code, you may see this warning.

Depending on whether the robot code is executed before DogLog's init code, you may encounter an error from your code about being unable to instantiate `PowerDistribution`.

## Solution

Removing the `new PowerDistribution()` line from your robot code will resolve the conflict with DogLog's instance of `PowerDistribution`.
Alternatively, if you don't care about DogLog's PDH logging, you can safely ignore this warning.

If using both DogLog and `PowerDistribution` is truly necessary, you can leave a reply on [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/jonahsnider/doglog/issues/20).
