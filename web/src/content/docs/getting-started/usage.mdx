Once installed, getting started with DogLog is super easy:

## Logging

First, import the library from the `dev.doglog` namespace:

```java
import dev.doglog.DogLog;
```

And then you can use `Doglog.log()` to log values like so:

```java
DogLog.log("Arm/Position", motor.getPosition().getValue());
```

You can include these log statements in your periodic methods, or anywhere else you want to log data.

## Configuring

DogLog comes with a safe, reasonable default configuration out of the box, but most users will want to customize it to their needs.

Here's an example of how to set DogLog to use custom options:

<Steps>

1. Import the library at the top of `Robot.java`/`RobotContainer.java`:

   ```java
    import dev.doglog.DogLog;
    import dev.doglog.DogLogOptions;
    import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DriverStation;
   ```

2. In your `Robot`/`RobotContainer` constructor, add the following lines:

   ```java
    DogLog.setOptions(new DogLogOptions().withNtPublish(!DriverStation.isFMSAttached()));
   ```

   This configures DogLog to use the default options as a base, and extends them to publish logged fields to NetworkTables when your robot isn't connected to the FMS.

   :::caution
   You don't have to use `DriverStation.isFMSAttached()` to determine whether to publish to NetworkTables, but you definitely should not be publishing to NetworkTables when using a flashed competition radio.

</Steps>

## Full example

```java {9-11,20}
package frc.robot;

import frc.robot.Constants.OperatorConstants;
import frc.robot.commands.ExampleCommand;
import frc.robot.subsystems.ExampleSubsystem;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.Command;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.CommandXboxController;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.Trigger;
import dev.doglog.DogLog;
import dev.doglog.DogLogOptions;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DriverStation;

public class RobotContainer {
  private final ExampleSubsystem m_exampleSubsystem = new ExampleSubsystem();

  private final CommandXboxController m_driverController =
      new CommandXboxController(OperatorConstants.kDriverControllerPort);

  public RobotContainer() {
    DogLog.setOptions(new DogLogOptions().withNtPublish(!DriverStation.isFMSAttached()));

    configureBindings();
  }

  private void configureBindings() {
    // ...
  }
}
```
