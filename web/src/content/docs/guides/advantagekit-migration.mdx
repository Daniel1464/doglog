title: Migrating from AdvantageKit
description: Migrate from AdvantageKit to DogLog.

import { FileTree, Steps, LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

DogLog's `AdvantageKitCompatibleLogger` class means that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for AdvantageKit logging.

`AdvantageKitCompatibleLogger` exposes the same exact interface as AdvantageKit's `Logger` class, but uses DogLog for all the logging functionality.

## Steps

<Steps>
1. Add DogLog to your project if you haven't already:

    <LinkCard
      title="Install guide"
      href="/getting-started/installation"
    />

2. Create a new file for the AdvantageKit `Logger` shim:

   <FileTree>

   - src
     - main
       - deploy/
       - java/
         - frc/
         - org
           - littletonrobotics
             - junction
               - **Logger.java** Create this file

    </FileTree>

3. In the newly created file, paste the following code:

   ```java title="src/main/java/org/littletonrobotics/junction/Logger.java"
   package org.littletonrobotics.junction;

   import dev.doglog.AdvantageKitCompatibleLogger;

   public class Logger extends AdvantageKitCompatibleLogger {}
   ```

   :::note
   Because this file has the same package & class name as AdvantageKit's `Logger` class, any references to `Logger` will use DogLog's `AdvantageKitCompatibleLogger` instead.
   :::

4. Remove AdvantageKit from your project
